* Notes

** An anonymous user has their document saved in local storage, when they sign up we take their existing document and make it the user's first document.

** On start up open most recent document (if the user has one) otherwise create a new one

** How to store documents

1 table for latest version of document.
1 table for log of documents, each version of the document is its own row.
